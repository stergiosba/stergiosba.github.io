# Projects

During my PhD I have had the pleasure of working on many different problems at the Human Oriented Robotics and Control lab at the University of Delaware. 


My research focuses on enhancing the physical intelligence of autonomous robots using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Applications of his work include the development of an autonomous probing agent for swarm leader identification and the creation of a whole-body loco-manipulation controller for quadruped robots.

# Swarm

The first three years of my PhD I focused on
- Creating a swarm research testbed to implement and study robotic swarms' algorithms.
- Developing a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework to study privacy in robotic swarms. 


This work resulted in two (2) conference publications and one (1) journal publication under review.

# Quadruped

This is my current work so please stay tuned for updates here.
